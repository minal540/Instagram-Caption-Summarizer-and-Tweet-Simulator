Instagram Caption Summarizer and Tweet Simulator
Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application that performs Instagram data scraping, caption summarization, and simulated tweet posting. The app scrapes Instagram posts, extracts captions, summarizes them using NLP techniques, and simulates posting the summarized captions on Twitter.

Features
Instagram Data Scraping: Fetches the latest Instagram post from a specified user.

Caption Extraction: Extracts the caption from the post.

Summarization: Summarizes the extracted caption using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Simulated Tweet: Saves the summarized caption as a simulated tweet in JSON format.

Technologies Used
Flask: Web framework for building the API.

Selenium: For scraping Instagram data dynamically.

BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML content and extracting Instagram captions.

NLTK: For Natural Language Processing and tokenization of the caption.

Sumy: For summarization of the Instagram post captions.

webdriver_manager: Automatically installs the Chrome WebDriver.

JSON: For saving simulated tweet data.

Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

pip (Python package manager)

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/instagram-caption-summarizer.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd instagram-caption-summarizer
Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download NLTK's punkt tokenizer:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
Usage
Run the Flask App:

Start the Flask application by running the following command:

python app.py
This will start the server locally on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Access the Endpoints:

To fetch Instagram data:

GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/fetch-instagram
This will fetch the latest Instagram post's caption from the account (e.g., @bbcnews).

To post a summarized tweet:

POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/post-tweet
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "caption": "The original caption you want to summarize"
}
This will return a summarized caption and save it in a file.

Notes
Instagram Scraping: This project uses Selenium to automate the process of scraping Instagram, and the Chrome WebDriver is required. Make sure that you have the appropriate WebDriver installed and that your browser version is compatible.

Summarization: The caption summarization uses basic NLP techniques (tokenization and simple truncation). You can improve this by integrating more advanced summarization models if needed.

Future Improvements
Enhance summarization using more advanced NLP models.

Support multiple Instagram profiles for dynamic user input.

Deploy the app on a server to make it accessible from anywhere.
